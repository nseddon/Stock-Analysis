# Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project
Our client (Steve) requested an analysis of the Stock Market for the years of 2017 and 2018.  Of particular interest was the stock for "Daqo", listed on the exchange as "DQ." Upon completion of this initial analysis, the program was enhanced to allow the client to further study any/all stocks during the year requested.

The client also requested formatting of the document to include "ease of read" features.  To accomodate this, conditional formatting was implemented to indicate positve and negative yearly performance.




### Results
Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.


#### Summary

- What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

- How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
