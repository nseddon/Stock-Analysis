# Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project
Our client (Steve) requested an analysis of the Stock Market for the years of 2017 and 2018.  Of particular interest was the stock for "Daqo", listed on the exchange as "DQ." Upon completion of this initial analysis, the program was enhanced to allow the client to further study any/all stocks during the year requested.

The client also requested formatting of the document to include "ease of read" features.  To accomodate this, conditional formatting was implemented to indicate positve and negative yearly performance.

After completing initial project, the code was refactored to allow for more data to be processed for future stock analysis.  The refactored code is more efficient in processing time, with the same results as the previous code (examples below).

### Results
